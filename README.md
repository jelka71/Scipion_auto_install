# scipion_auto_install
Bash script to install Scipion (https://scipion.i2pc.es/) into one single diretory with a dedicated miniconda install that also contains Scipions config, plugins etc inside the same diretory.

This script also includes TOMO devel plugins, but can easyly be cut out of script. 

The whole install with the selected packages consumes at the time of writing, 72 GB, so be warned!

NOTE: Please edit the top of the script before running, as e.g. install location and a few paths needs to be set prior to install.
