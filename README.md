# scipion_auto_install
Bash script to install Scipion (https://scipion.i2pc.es/) into one single diretory with a dedicated miniconda install that also contains Scipions config, plugins etc inside the same diretory.

This script also includes TOMO devel plugins, but can easyly be cut out of script. 

NOTE: Please edit the top of the script before running, as e.g. install location and a few paths needs to be set prior to install.
